## Analysis

**_Why aren't women riding as much as men?_**

From the observations above it is clear that women are riding less than men, why you ask, it can be explained by a few factors:

1. Women are more risk adverse than men meaning, in short, that riding in heavy traffic or crowded streets is a riskier proposition, evaluation of the risk of riding a bike leads more women to drive instead of biking.
1. Women are more likely to be involved in household activities such as taking kids to school, purchasing groceries, or taking care of others.  These kind of activities are difficult to perform on a bicycle.  These would be barriers into using a bike...
1. Bicycling as youth, males are generally encouraged and taught to ride a bike early on.  Studies show that as a youth even though women have been taught to ride a bike, safety is a bigger concern amongst parents with regard to female ridership, whereas males are left to ride wherever they want.

These concerns are further reinforced by the following research and articles about the subject:

## Recommendations

1. Encourage parents to teach their daughters how to ride, take them to bicycle safety classes, ensure they know the rules of the road.  Allow them to ride to or more diverse set of destinations without fear or worry, instilling confidence.
1. Invest in bicycles that have baskets not only in the front, but also side mounted, so that they may be able to carry additional items with them such as groceries or purses.
1. Include bicycles with a child seat or an option to mount your own.
1. Work with local municipalities to install proper bike lanes and signage, make fines and laws stricter regarding bicyclistsâ€™ rights.
1. Institute bicycle safety and awareness clinics on a periodic basis for both cyclists and non-cyclists alike.
1. Create a female ridership incentive program such as "a friend rides free" or "ladies day out" to encourage ridership.
